Developed a MERN stack web application replicating core features of Flipkart, including product
browsing, cart management, and secure checkout. Ensured responsive design and optimized
performance.



There are lots of bug in this application but I created this application while learning MERN framework,

so it was a learning with building kind of project and I may fix those bugs and add new functionality

in the Flipkart-clone application in near future.


Technologies Used: React.js, Material-UI (Frontend), Node.js, Express.js (Backend).
database:- mongoDB.


I have planned to enhance the application by integrating unique features such as AI-powered price comparison,

broad product matching, custom price alerts, and historical price tracking,

as I continue to explore and work with new technologies.

Developed a MERN stack web application replicating core features of Flipkart, including product 
browsing, cart management, and secure checkout. Ensured responsive design and optimized 
performance. 
Technologies Used: React.js, Material-UI (Frontend), Node.js, Express.js (Backend).
database:- mongodb.
 I have planned to enhance the application by integrating unique features such as AI-powered price comparison, broad product matching, custom price alerts, and historical price tracking, as I continue to explore and work with new technologies.
